code for A Latent Multi-Scale Residual Transformer Approach for Cross-Modal Medical Image Generation

This paper focuses on cross-modal medical image synthesis tasks involving multi-contrast MRI and MRI-to-CT conversion. Extensive experiments on three datasets—spine, brain, and pelvis—demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The paper will be submitted to Signal, Image and Video Processing, and we will organize and release the model code after the paper is accepted.
